# Sign_Language_Translation
This repo contains the Sign Language Translation from video to text project done with my colleague Omar Souaidi as the final project of Object Recognition and computer Vision (MVA)


Sign Language Translation (SLT) first uses a Sign Language Recognition (SLR) system to extract sign language glosses  from  videos.Then,  a  translation  system  generates spoken language translations from the sign language glosses.  In this project, we try to improve the performance of Sign Language Transformers by explicitly or implicitly  modelling  the  body  pose  (e.g.    Hands,  Face,  UpperBody).
The code are available here: https://github.com/omarsou/sign_language_project
